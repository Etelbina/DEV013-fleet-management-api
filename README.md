Fleet Management Software is an API REST to check the vehicle locations of a taxi company in Beijing, China.

The client has installed GPS devices to precisely determine the geographic coordinates of the taxis location at all times using satellite signals. And wireless sensors connected to the Internet to know the conditions of the vehicles and send alerts in case of eventualities.

The fleet is almost 10 thousand taxis, so it has been essential to develop efficient techniques to store, consult and analyze this information and guarantee the best user experience.

Our client requires:

Load information from SQL files to a Postgresql database.
Develop a REST API that allows you to consult, through HTTP requests, the information stored in the database.
